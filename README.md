# 30-Days-of-JavaScript
I found a nice resource on learning JavaScript and here I will uploading my daily learning for 30 days. Instead of a one shot video on JavaScript i opted for a 30 day version because i believe that going slow and understanding things is always better than just focusing on completing it as soon as possible
